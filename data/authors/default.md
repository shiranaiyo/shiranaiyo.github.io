I'm in the last semester of my Master's in Pure Mathematics at the Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos, Peru. I'm trying to understand better the foundations of mathematics and improve them if possible.

I believe that, in the future, all our formal knowledge will be verified by computer programs. I wish to participate in both the conceptual development, as well as the concrete implementation of these systems.

Humans are born ignorant and will die so. But every single day we learn a little bit more.
